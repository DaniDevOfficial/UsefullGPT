### Overview of a Scalable API Architecture in Go

When building a large API in Go, you want to focus on **maintainability**, **modularity**, and **scalability**. Here's a simple overview of how to structure your API in a clean, reusable way:

---

### **1. Project Structure:**
A typical Go project follows a clean architecture or layered approach, where different concerns (e.g., HTTP routing, business logic, database access) are separated into their own packages.

Hereâ€™s an example structure:
```
myapp/
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/                    # Entry points (main packages)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.go          # Main file to start the HTTP server
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/                # Application-specific code (not accessible by external packages)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users/               # User module (similar structure for other modules like teams, tournaments)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ handlers.go      # HTTP handlers for user-related routes
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service.go       # Business logic layer
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repository.go    # Data access layer (e.g., querying PostgreSQL)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ models.go        # Data models for users
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tournaments/         # Tournament module with similar structure as users
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg/                     # Reusable packages across the project
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ db/                  # Database connection setup, utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ api/                     # OpenAPI specs, API documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                  # Configuration files (e.g., environment, settings)
â””â”€â”€ go.mod                   # Go module file
```

### **2. Key Components:**
Here are the key layers and how they work together:

- **`cmd/`**: Contains the entry point to the application. This is where your `main()` function lives, which starts the HTTP server.

- **`internal/`**: Contains all the core business logic, divided into different modules. Each module has its own:
    - **Handlers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses.
    - **Service Layer**: Contains business logic. This layer ensures that any logic beyond simple database queries stays separate from the handlers.
    - **Repository Layer**: Directly interacts with the database. This is where SQL queries live.
    - **Models**: Define the data structures (e.g., `User`, `Tournament`) used across layers.

- **`pkg/`**: Reusable utilities and packages, like database connection setup (`pkg/db/`).

### **3. Example Workflow:**
For a request like "GET a user by ID," hereâ€™s how it flows:
- The **handler** parses the request, passes it to the **service** layer.
- The **service** applies any business rules (e.g., permissions, validation) and then calls the **repository**.
- The **repository** executes the database query and returns the data.
- The **service** formats the response (e.g., as JSON) and returns it to the **handler**, which sends it back to the client.

### Example: Structuring Your Code

#### **Handlers (HTTP Layer)**:
```go
// internal/users/handlers.go
package users

import (
	"net/http"
	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

// GetUserByIDHandler is the HTTP handler to get a user by ID
func GetUserByIDHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	vars := mux.Vars(r)
	userID := vars["id"]

	user, err := userService.GetUserByID(userID)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusNotFound)
		return
	}

	// Return user as JSON response
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(user)
}
```

#### **Service Layer (Business Logic)**:
```go
// internal/users/service.go
package users

// UserService defines the methods related to user operations
type UserService interface {
	GetUserByID(id string) (*User, error)
}

type userService struct {
	repo UserRepository
}

// GetUserByID gets a user by ID from the repository
func (s *userService) GetUserByID(id string) (*User, error) {
	return s.repo.FindByID(id)
}

// NewUserService creates a new instance of UserService
func NewUserService(repo UserRepository) UserService {
	return &userService{repo: repo}
}
```

#### **Repository Layer (Data Access)**:
```go
// internal/users/repository.go
package users

import "database/sql"

// UserRepository defines data access methods for users
type UserRepository interface {
	FindByID(id string) (*User, error)
}

type userRepository struct {
	db *sql.DB
}

// FindByID finds a user by ID in the database
func (r *userRepository) FindByID(id string) (*User, error) {
	query := `SELECT id, username, email, password, created_at FROM users WHERE id = $1`
	user := &User{}

	err := r.db.QueryRow(query, id).Scan(&user.ID, &user.Username, &user.Email, &user.Password, &user.CreatedAt)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return user, nil
}

// NewUserRepository creates a new instance of UserRepository
func NewUserRepository(db *sql.DB) UserRepository {
	return &userRepository{db: db}
}
```

### **4. Best Practices for API Architecture**:
1. **Modularity**: Each module (e.g., `users`, `tournaments`) should encapsulate everything related to that feature: handlers, services, repositories, and models.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies (like `db` or repositories) to services and handlers via constructors to make the code easier to test and maintain.
3. **Configuration Management**: Store configuration (like database connection strings) in environment variables or a config file.
4. **Error Handling**: Make sure all layers handle errors correctly and return useful responses to the API client (e.g., `404` for not found, `500` for server errors).
