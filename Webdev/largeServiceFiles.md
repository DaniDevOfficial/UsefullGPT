### 1. **Split by Feature or Responsibility**
Instead of having all the service logic for a module (like `users`) in a single `service.go` file, you can break it down by **specific responsibilities** or **functionalities**. Each part of the service can handle a related set of actions.

For example, in your "ticket app" context, you might have different responsibilities like **ticket purchasing**, **ticket validation**, and **reporting**. You can split these functionalities into different files.

#### Example of Splitting Services for a Ticket App:
If you have a `users` module with a huge `service.go`, you could break it down like this:

```
internal/
├── users/
│   ├── handlers.go       // Handles HTTP requests for users
│   ├── repository.go     // Data access logic for users
│   ├── service/
│   │   ├── user.go       // General user-related logic (CRUD operations)
│   │   ├── auth.go       // Authentication, login, and password management
│   │   └── profile.go    // Profile-related logic
│   └── models.go         // User data models
```

In this case, we have:
- **`user.go`**: Handles user registration, updating user info, etc.
- **`auth.go`**: Handles user authentication, password resets, etc.
- **`profile.go`**: Handles user profile actions, like updating avatar, etc.

Each file will only contain service functions related to the responsibility it handles, making your code cleaner.

#### Example Code for `auth.go`:
```go
// internal/users/service/auth.go
package users

// AuthService defines authentication-related methods
type AuthService interface {
	Login(email, password string) (*User, error)
	ResetPassword(email string) error
}

type authService struct {
	repo UserRepository
}

// NewAuthService creates a new instance of AuthService
func NewAuthService(repo UserRepository) AuthService {
	return &authService{repo: repo}
}

// Login authenticates a user by their email and password
func (s *authService) Login(email, password string) (*User, error) {
	user, err := s.repo.FindByEmail(email)
	if err != nil || !CheckPasswordHash(password, user.Password) {
		return nil, errors.New("invalid credentials")
	}
	return user, nil
}

// ResetPassword handles password reset logic
func (s *authService) ResetPassword(email string) error {
	// Logic for sending reset link
	return nil
}
```

#### Example Code for `user.go`:
```go
// internal/users/service/user.go
package users

// UserService defines user-related operations
type UserService interface {
	Register(user *User) error
	UpdateUser(user *User) error
	DeleteUser(userID string) error
}

type userService struct {
	repo UserRepository
}

// NewUserService creates a new instance of UserService
func NewUserService(repo UserRepository) UserService {
	return &userService{repo: repo}
}

// Register handles user registration logic
func (s *userService) Register(user *User) error {
	return s.repo.Save(user)
}

// UpdateUser handles updating user info
func (s *userService) UpdateUser(user *User) error {
	return s.repo.Update(user)
}

// DeleteUser handles user deletion
func (s *userService) DeleteUser(userID string) error {
	return s.repo.Delete(userID)
}
```

### 2. **Create Service Subdirectories**
If your module has a large number of service files, consider grouping them into **subdirectories**. For example, if your ticket app deals with tickets, purchases, and events, you can create a service directory like this:

```
internal/
└── tickets/
    └── service/
        ├── ticket.go        // Handles ticket-related logic
        ├── purchase.go      // Handles ticket purchasing logic
        └── event.go         // Handles event-related logic
```

This way, all services related to `tickets` are still kept in a single directory, but split by their responsibility.

### 3. **Separate Common Logic into Helper or Utility Packages**
If you find that some code is repeated across multiple services (e.g., validation logic, date formatting, or reusable queries), it's a good idea to extract these into a separate package. This keeps your service layer clean and focused on business logic.

For instance:
```
internal/
└── utils/
    ├── validation.go       // Validation functions used across services
    └── password.go         // Password hashing functions
```

### Example Utility Function:
```go
// internal/utils/validation.go
package utils

import "errors"

// ValidateEmail checks if the email is valid
func ValidateEmail(email string) error {
	if len(email) < 5 || !strings.Contains(email, "@") {
		return errors.New("invalid email format")
	}
	return nil
}
```

### 4. **Interface Segregation (Breaking Large Interfaces)**
If your service interface is becoming too large, split it into smaller interfaces based on functionality. This approach is part of the **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** from SOLID principles.

#### Before:
```go
// Large interface
type UserService interface {
	Register(user *User) error
	Login(email, password string) (*User, error)
	UpdateUser(user *User) error
	DeleteUser(userID string) error
	ResetPassword(email string) error
}
```

#### After (Split Interfaces):
```go
// Split into smaller interfaces for modularity
type UserAccountService interface {
	Register(user *User) error
	UpdateUser(user *User) error
	DeleteUser(userID string) error
}

type AuthService interface {
	Login(email, password string) (*User, error)
	ResetPassword(email string) error
}
```

This makes your code easier to maintain and test because each service interface is small, focused, and only does one thing.

### 5. **Use Service Factories for Better Modularity**
When splitting your services, you can use **factory functions** to create instances of the service with the required dependencies.

#### Example:
```go
// Factory for creating services
func NewUserServices(repo UserRepository) (UserService, AuthService) {
	return NewUserService(repo), NewAuthService(repo)
}
```
This approach keeps your `main.go` or higher-level code clean when creating services.

### 6. **Create Domain-Specific Packages**
Another approach is to create domain-specific packages, grouping related logic together. This can be done especially if you have clearly defined domains like **Orders**, **Users**, **Payments**, etc.

For example, you might have a structure like this for a ticket booking system:
```
internal/
└── orders/
    ├── service/
    │   ├── order.go          // Handles order-related logic
    │   └── payment.go        // Handles payment-related logic
    └── repository.go         // Handles database queries for orders
```
This keeps everything focused on a specific domain, and the service logic for each domain is separated.

### Summary of Techniques to Split Large Service Files:
1. **Split by Responsibility**: Divide the service logic into smaller files by functionality (e.g., `user.go`, `auth.go`, etc.).
2. **Use Subdirectories**: Organize service files into subdirectories if the module is large (e.g., `service/ticket.go`, `service/purchase.go`).
3. **Extract Common Logic**: Move shared logic (e.g., validation, formatting) into utility packages to avoid duplication.
4. **Smaller Interfaces**: Follow the Interface Segregation Principle by breaking large interfaces into smaller, more focused ones.
5. **Service Factories**: Use service factory functions to easily instantiate services with dependencies.
6. **Domain-Specific Packages**: Group service files by domain to keep related logic together.
